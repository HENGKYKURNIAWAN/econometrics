# 1. Intro to Method
## 1.1 Method 1   
In this paper I apply the algorithm method developed by SUl 2010
The study of economic convergence has been the heart of economic growth study after the neoclassical model of Ramsey (1928) and Solow (1956). Later, Sala-i-Martin (1990) distinguished the terminology of ??(beta)-convergence and ??(sigma)-convergence. In this regards, ??-convergence measures the "catch-up" effect of poor countries (regions) to the rich countries (regions), while ??-convergence measures the cross-sectional dispersion of per capita income of countries (regions) across the time. The convergence analysis has gained its popularity since the seminal papers by Barro (1991), and Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1992).
     
         
         

# 2. Convergence Analysis
## 2.1 Method


The dispersions of Indonesia's per capita GRP and some selected social indicators are declining for the last two decades with its neighbouring countries, especially with ASEAN and Asian countries. As discussed in part 2, the social indicators converge towards improvement. But, on the other hand, if we look at the regional dimension within Indonesia the Gini indices consistently increased in the last two decades. Moreover, the Indonesian Gini index is increasing starting from the beginning of year 2000. 
Analysing the behaviour of regional indicators then becomes interesting as we look at the convergence in provincial level of some indicators, especially the economic indicator.

The study of economic convergence has been the heart of economic growth study after the neoclassical model of Ramsey (1928) and Solow (1956). Later, Sala-i-Martin (1990) distinguished the terminology of ??(beta)-convergence and ??(sigma)-convergence. In this regards, ??-convergence measures the "catch-up" effect of poor countries (regions) to the rich countries (regions), while ??-convergence measures the cross-sectional dispersion of per capita income of countries (regions) across the time. The convergence analysis has gained its popularity since the seminal papers by Barro (1991), and Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1992).

Many literatures have also discussed the relationship between beta and sigma convergence, in which beta-convergence is a necessary condition for the existence of sigma-convergence. Later Furceri (2005) proves mathematically the relation between those two. Adding to the analysis of beta-convergence, authors have made distinction between absolute and conditional convergence to overcome the condition for steady state in per capita income. For example, see Sala-i-Martin (1995) and Islam (1995, 2003). 

On the Indonesian context, Garcia and Soelistianingsih (1997) was the first paper to test the existence of convergence by analysing the ??-convergence methodology for both absolute and conditional convergence. Later, Resosudarmo and Vidyattama (2006) and Vidyattama (2013) use panel data of Indonesian provinces and districts level to analyse the disparity of provincial and district income in Indonesia. While Hill et.al (2007) provide analysis of Indonesia's geographical changes in development.

In the latest development of convergence analysis, Phillips and Sul (2007) (PS) have developed a methodology that allowing for individual heterogeneities. The methodology is based on clustering algorithm to identify if the non-convergent sample has convergence club. With this type of analysis we are able to identify the cross-sectional relative position of each individual in the sample across the time.
In this section we apply the methodology developed by PS using Indonesia's provincial data. Indonesia provides an interesting study of regional economic growth since it has been known as an archipelago with more than 17 thousands islands lie from the west to the east, with five main islands: Sumatra, Java, Kalimantan, Sulawesi, and Papua. Along with the island of Bali, Maluku, and Nusa Tenggara, the country comprises of 33 provinces (see table 4.1).  Each Island has its own unique characteristics of languages, cultures, and also the development issues. 
In the term of regional development , Indonesia has been divided into two greater regions i.e. Western regions (Sumatra, Java, Kalimantan, and Bali) and Eastern regions (Sulawesi, Maluku, Papua, West Nusa Tenggara, and East Nusa Tenggara). Many have argued that there is a huge gap in development among the regions in Indonesia that the western regions are more developed than the eastern regions. This may be because the past development policy had only focused in Java. 
Whether the huge gap of development in the past persists until now and whether some poor regions are able to catch up the richer regions, the analysis of the income distribution need to be carried out further to answer these questions. The analysis of the role of geographical location is also important in this matter.


You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
